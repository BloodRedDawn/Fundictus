# Fundictus
First Release

I uploaded this as a pre-release for now because of delia update there are still a few bugs with the config editor.
 - While you are logged on a character and you open the config file for that character the program will throw an error at you.
 - The highlight feature on the config editor is working but buggy atm.
 
Will update this more once i start working again on Fundictus but for now because of recent development in the vindictus community
i will be busy learning about something very interesting.

I will keep you guys updated ;)
